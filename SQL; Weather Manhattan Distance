Consider  and  to be two points on a 2D plane.

 happens to equal the minimum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
 happens to equal the minimum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
 happens to equal the maximum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
 happens to equal the maximum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
Query the Manhattan Distance between points  and  and round it to a scale of  decimal places.

/*
In a plane with p1 at (x1, y1) and p2 at (x2, y2), it is |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|.
*/

SELECT round(abs(min(lat_n)-min(long_w))+ abs(max(lat_n)- max(long_w)),4)
FROM station;

My initial answer that I quickly wrote produced an incorrect result: 19.9191
