Julia just finished conducting a coding contest, and she needs your help assembling the leaderboard!
Write a query to print the respective hacker_id and name of hackers who achieved full scores for more than one challenge.
Order your output in descending order by the total number of challenges in which the hacker earned a full score.
If more than one hacker received full scores in same number of challenges, then sort them by ascending hacker_id.

----------------------------------

1)SELECT id and name
2)List the tables 
3)Combine hacker_id
4)Combine challenge_id
5)Combine difficulty_level
*I did not do this for my original answer.
*When I attempt this problem again, I will likely forget again.
*The problem never really states that difficulty level matters.
6)Combine scores on difficult and submission table
7)Group by h.hacker id and name
8)Must have more than one challenge
9)Sort by ascending hacker_id

SELECT h.hacker_id, h.name
FROM hackers h, difficulty d, challenges c, submissions s
WHERE h.hacker_id=s.hacker_id
AND c.challenge_id=s.challenge_id
AND c.difficulty_level=d.difficulty_level
AND d.score = s.score
GROUP BY h.hacker_id, h.name
HAVING count(h.hacker_id)>1
ORDER BY count(c.challenge_id) DESC, h.hacker_id;
