Consider  and  to be two points on a 2D plane where  are the respective minimum and maximum values of Northern Latitude (LAT_N)
and  are the respective minimummand maximum values of Western Longitude (LONG_W) in STATION.

Query the Euclidean Distance between points  and  and format your answer to display  decimal digits.
-----------------------------------------------

My initial answer:
SELECT round(sqrt
(power (min(lat_n)-min(long_w),2) 
+ power (max(lat_n)- max(long_w),2))
,4)
FROM station;

Final correct answer:
SELECT round(sqrt
(power((min(lat_n)-max(lat_n)),2)
+ power((min(long_w)-max(long_w)),2))
,4)
From station

Consider  and  to be two points on a 2D plane.

 happens to equal the minimum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
 happens to equal the minimum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
 happens to equal the maximum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
 happens to equal the maximum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
Query the Manhattan Distance between points  and  and round it to a scale of  decimal places.

/*
In a plane with p1 at (x1, y1) and p2 at (x2, y2), it is |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|.
*/

SELECT round(
    abs(min(lat_n)- max(lat_n ) )+
    abs(min(long_w) -max(long_w) )
             ,4)
FROM station;
