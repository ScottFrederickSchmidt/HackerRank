Input Format
The OCCUPATIONS table is described as follows:
Occupation will only contain one of the following values: Doctor, Professor, Singer or Actor.

Sample Input
Sample Output

Jenny    Ashley     Meera  Jane
Samantha Christeen  Priya  Julia

Explanation

The first column is an alphabetically ordered list of Doctor names.
The second column is an alphabetically ordered list of Professor names.
The third column is an alphabetically ordered list of Singer names.
The fourth column is an alphabetically ordered list of Actor names.
The empty cell data for columns with less than the maximum number of names per occupation (in this case, the Professor and Actor columns) are filled with NULL values.

Enter your query here and follow these instructions:
1. Please append a semicolon ";" at the end of the query and enter your query in a single line to avoid error.
2. The AS keyword causes errors, so follow this convention: "Select t.Field From table1 t" instead of "select t.Field From table1 AS t"
3. Type your code immediately after comment. Don't leave any blank line.

This problem relies on using a pivot table.
