-------------------------

#Retrieve name if grade above 8, grade, and marks:
SELECT IF(grade<8, null, name), grade, marks

#Combine the two tables:
FROM students JOIN grades

#This is the hardest line to comprehend! 
#This will only grab data if the number is between 0 and 100 because some may not have a grade yet.
WHERE marks BETWEEN min_mark AND max_mark

#The report must be in descending order by grade, then name, finally marks:
ORDER BY grade DESC, name, marks;

#FINAL SOLUTION:
SELECT IF(grade<8, null, name), grade, marks
FROM students JOIN grades
WHERE marks BETWEEN min_mark AND max_mark
ORDER BY grade DESC, name, marks;
